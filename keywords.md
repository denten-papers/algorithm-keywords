Preliminary Remarks on Algorithm as a Social Construction

I would like consider the concept of an algorithm apart from its rich history
in mathematics, which stems back to the work the great ninth-century Persian
mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, the "one from Kwarizm" (modern Khiva), the eponym
also at the root of the Spanish *guarismo*, meaning decimal number.[^1]
According to Donald Knuth, one of modern day's most significant scholars and
architects of algorithm, the word should simply mean a "well defined process"
which includes the "structuring of data" as well as the "sequence of
operations being performed. He writes also about the "miscellaneous methods
for the solution of particular problems analogous to individual theorems in
mathematics."[^2]

The alternative history of algorithms I propose here points to a particular
kind of an inscription---a script---a type of an imperative utterance and
thereby more broadly a species of *agency displaced* in time and place
particular to all imperatives, be they machine code or legal codex. Viewed
from the vantage point of political theory, the social problems of the sort
Frank Pasquale identifies in his *The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms
That Control Money and Information*---the opaque nature of algorithmic control
regimes like search engines, spam filters, and high-speed financial trading
bots---can be perceived as part of a long-standing debate about the nature of
political formation, particularly as it relates to issues of personal agency,
culpability, and consent.[^3]

Consider the following simple thought experiment. You are wont to eat toast
for breakfast. To make the toast you usually place a slice of bread into a
machine especially for this purpose, a toaster. The machine takes several
minutes to complete its task. Imagine also being once interrupted shortly
after the start of the toasting process. An urgent phone call takes you out of
the kitchen. What are we to make of the machine absent the source of its
volitional impetus? Does it "make" the toast on its own? Does it "want" to
make it? Were an accident to happen, a fire or an electrical malfunction, who
would be responsible, the machine, its manufacturer, or its absent master?

Whatever legal intuitions the reader may have in this regard, consider them a
part of the larger political problematic. The same questions would present
themselves if instead of the machine, the ordinating agent would delegate the
responsibility for completing the task to a family member, by leaving a set of
detailed instructions to be performed on your behalf at a later time. Words
like "delegate" and "on your behalf" indicate what I have been calling a kind
the problem of displaced agency. The action completes in the absence of the
originating agency. It seems magical in a sense: the machine (our humble
toaster or a recipe for toast) contains a disembodied spark of its originating
intention: want, appetite, desire.

Under normal circumstances, the will and the performance of an action are
connected causally, in a chain of what Ludwig Wittgenstein has described as a
kind of rigid mechanism or a "super obedient" person. The subject and the
object of action occupy the same contiguous time and space. The algorithm
lengthens the causal chain between subject and object, making the flows of
agency more difficult to reconstruct properly. The absence of the subject
gives rise to the autopoetic illusion. The toaster "wants to make bread" just
like the phone seems "smart" and corporations hold the right to free speech.
It is all the more tempting to ascribe a kind of an inner life, a
phenomenology, to objects that display the property of displaced volition. In
this sense, the seemingly recent problem of algorithmic accountability---to
what extent do algorithms produce market volatility, or are produced by
it?---is related to the problem of continuing consent as expressed in the
thought of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Like algorithms, laws continue to
govern based on consensual structures that persist far past the originating
accord. Classical liberal thought imagines democratic governance to function
through a kind of consentual agreement among free individuals, but the laws
and regulations that the initial consent creates continue to govern among
members who have not participated in the political process explicitly. They
consent tacitly, through simple inhabitance of the governed territory, and are
thereby disenfranchised in the process.

It is important to see algorithm is light of this political tradition, because
without it the problematics of automated machinery appear wholly exceptional
and disconnected form their cultural concept. Once we see algorithms as a mode
of governance, we can begin to perceive governance as a kind of algorithmic
thinking.

Reestablishing agency is difficult but possible.
Algorithmic governance. Tools of software engineering like fuzzy "stress
testing" and code mutation can help bring forth new political experiments
through new modes of social interaction. Conversly, algorithm as mathematical
abstraction, gains a new historical meaning within the long history of.

It "frees us from the habit of approaching the topic in terms of analogies"
alone, worst of all in Djakastra's conception the prevailing anthropmorphism
when it comes to algorithms that "try to do things," "want to do things,"
"believe things to be true," "know things," and so on. These are not harmless
metaphors, Dkajastra argues. The analogy enacts a barrier to understanding the
formal nature of the instructions. Even more problematically for us, the
anthromorphism of algorithm obscures causal chains that lead to actors engaged
in the struggle for capital in control, ascribing to the system an
extra-rational aura of fetish and mysticism and thereby diminishing our
capacity to
